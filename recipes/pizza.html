    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>For the dough:</h3>
        <li>300g/10½oz strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp rapeseed oil</li>
        <li>150–175ml/5–6fl oz lukewarm water</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>

        <h3>For the topping</h3>
        <li>120g/4½oz passata</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>½ tsp dried mixed herbs</li>
        <li>½ tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1 mozzarella ball, torn into small pieces</li>
        <li>10 pepperoni slices</li>
        <li>30g/1oz cheddar, grated</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and place a large baking tray upside-down on a shelf.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To make the dough, sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl. Add the salt and a pinch of pepper, then stir in the oil. Make a well in the centre, then stir in the warm water and mix to a soft dough, drawing the flour in from the side of the bowl a little at a time – you might need to add another 25ml/1fl oz water if the dough is a little dry; you want it to be slightly sticky and soft.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 2 minutes, until smooth and springy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place a sheet of greaseproof paper on the work surface, then dust with a little flour and place the dough on top of it. Carefully roll the dough out into a 30cm/12in disc, roughly the thickness of a pound coin. Pick the paper up and carefully slide it onto the hot baking tray in the oven. Bake for 3 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, pour the passata into a bowl, then add the tomato purée, mixed herbs and sea salt and black pepper and mix.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove the dough tray from the oven. Cover the base with the tomato sauce, using the back of a spoon, leaving a small gap around the edges of the dough. Scatter the mozzarella over the tomato sauce, then top with the pepperoni and cheddar (you can add any other toppings you fancy at this point – see tips below.)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes, or until the base has puffed up and is cooked through and the cheese is golden and bubbling. Cut into wedges and serve immediately.</li>
